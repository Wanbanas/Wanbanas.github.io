	<p>Faster, smarter, and lighter than ever, computers today are shrinking in size, and in the booming wearable tech world, thatâ€™s a good thing. From fitness trackers to medical implants, the demand for wearable technology is rapidly increasing. Earlier this year, CCS Insight, which analyzes the mobile and wireless industries worldwide, forecasted that the wearable tech market will grow from approximately <strong>$10 billion in 2017 to nearly $17 billion by 2021.</strong> The forecast highlighted the smartwatch market, which is expected to see shipments of <strong>43 million units in 2017,</strong> and sales doubling over the next four years to 86 million units in 2021.</p>
